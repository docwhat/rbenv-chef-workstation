# rbenv-chef-workstation: Use Chef Workstation with rbenv

This plugin lets you treat [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/) as another version in [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/).

Chef Workstation replaces ChefDK. If you want to use ChefDK instead, then use the old [rbenv-chefdk plugin](https://github.com/docwhat/rbenv-chefdk) instead.

## Requirements

-   [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/) installed in `/opt/chef-workstation`

## Installation

To install rbenv-chef-workstation, clone this repository into the `$(rbenv root)/plugins` directory.

```sh
$ mkdir $(rbenv root)/plugins
$ cd $(rbenv root)/plugins
$ git clone <url>
```

**Warning:** If you've previously installed Chef Workstation, you will want to undo the changes recommended in the [Chef Workstation install instructions](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby) or in the Homebrew info gist. Otherwise `rbenv` or Chef Workstation will not work correctly.

Then create an empty directory in `$(rbenv root)/versions` called `chef-workstation`:

```sh
$ mkdir "$(rbenv root)/versions/chef-workstation"
```

Finally, change to the new `chef-workstation` version and run `rbenv rehash`.

```sh
$ rbenv shell chef-workstation
$ rbenv rehash
$ rbenv which ruby
/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin/ruby
```

That's it!

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems, try running `sanity-check.sh`:

```sh
$ $SHELL "$(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-chef-workstation/sanity-check.sh"
```

### Error running commands and errors talk about chefdk

Make sure you have completely uninstalled chefdk:

```sh
# This removes old Gems and the rbenv-chefdk plugin.
$ rm -rf ~/.chefdk "$(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-chefdk" "$(rbenv root)/versions/chefdk"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Hey, what happened to `gem`?

With the Chef Workstation you have to use `chef gem` instead.

### Why don't you include `/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin`?

We don't fully include the `/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin` directory because it'll break your system in subtle ways.

`/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin` has commands like `clear`, `tput`, `xsltproc`, and `xz`. These are commands that are part of your system and are only included in Chef Workstation so it gets reliable results across platforms.

If we made shims of these commands, your system might break when not using chef-workstation and can produce unexpected results even if you were using chef-workstation if your version of these commands are different (e.g. Gnu vs. BSD or version).

### Why not just symlink `/opt/chef-workstation/embedded` to `$(rbenv root)/versions/chef-workstation`?

For the same reason we don't include `/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin`: It breaks systems commands in unexpected ways.

### Rbenv isn't working or is using gems from the wrong place

Make sure you undid any changes recommended by the [Chef Workstation install instructions](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby) or in the Homebrew info gist.

Specifically, make sure you aren't calling `chef shell-init` anyplace in your shell startup files.

### "can't find executable chef (Gem::Exception)"

This is because you are using [`rbenv-bundle-exec`](https://github.com/maljub01/rbenv-bundle-exec).

You'll have to tell `rbenv-bundle-exec` to ignore a bunch of binaries that are only in Chef Workstation:

```sh
echo chef >> ~/.no_bundle_exec
echo berks >> ~/.no_bundle_exec
```
